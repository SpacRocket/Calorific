Bored with tedious data entry to Fitatu or Yazio? Check out this app!

ToDo:
- Chrome extenstion:
  - Pick text and then get nutritients. /DONE
  - Content script modification so that underneath there is macro table. /DONE
  - BUG with duplication of tables. /DONE
- Automatic translation to english, because API supports only english. ( deepl seems to be ok )
- Table that enables to divide by servings.
- Safari extention:
  - Migrate it to the Safari too.
- Yazio or Fitatu integration.
- Apple Health app:
  - More details about nutritients.

ToDo, publishing: 
- Create webservice so that the extension doesn't need to have api stored.
